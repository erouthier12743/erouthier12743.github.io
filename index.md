  <div class="bio">I am a PhD Student in Harvard's Biogeochemistry of Glob Contaminants group, advised by Dr. Elsie Sunderland. I am interested in understanding mercury cycling using novel techniques, such as isotope mixing. Running, woodworking, and cooking are some of my favorite daily activities, and I like to take hiking, biking and camping trips whenever I can.</div>
