  <h1>Evan Routhier</h1>
  <p> I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://bgc.seas.harvard.edu/">Biogeochemistry of Global Contaminants group in the department of Environmental Science and Engineering at Harvard<p>
  <p> University. I am broadly interested in applying sampling and analytical techniques to understand how contaminants cycle in the environment<p>
  <p> and impact wildlife and human health. Currently, I apply isotope measurements to understanding the sources and cycling of mercury in the environment <p>
