<p>Hello, I am a graduate student in the Biogeochemical of Global Contaminants group in the department of Environmental Science and Engineering at<p>
<p> Harvard University. I am broadly interested in understanding how contaminants cycle in the environment and impact wildlife and human health.<p>
<p> Currently, I apply isotope measurements to understanding the sources and cycling of mercury in the environment and foodwebs.<p>
