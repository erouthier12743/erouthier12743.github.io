*Bachelor of Science - Biochemistry, 2020*\
*Bachelor of Science - Environmental Sciences, 2020*

**Homestead High School**\
Science Department Prize in Environmental Science

### Relevant Experience

**Physical Scientist (2020-2022)**, USGS Mercury Research Lab\

### Service and Leadership

**Boy Scouts of America - Eagle scout**


**UW - Madison Track Club board member**
Organize team events and plan the season's race schedule

### Projects and Research

**Malagasy dietary mercury exposure**\
Working with Dr. Elsie Sunderland and Dr. Chris Golden, we are investigating/
the dietary sources of mercury for two populations of people who display distinct/
dietary patterns. Dietary sources of mercury are determined using a toxicokinetic/
model and isotope mixing model. Affects of diet on mercury processing are/
interpreted using microbiome data. This work is in progress.

**Mercury in the Rio Negro, Brazil**\
Working with Dr. Sunderland and Dr. Scot Martin, work to investigate the sources/
of mercury to the Rio Negro will begin in September 2023. This work is done in/
collaboration with members of Amazonas State University in Manaus, Brazil./
This work is in progress

**Mercury contamination to Gruber's Grove Bay, Lake Wisconsin**\
Determining the source of legacy contamination in Gruber's Grove Bay, which is/
proximal to a retired ammunition plant operated by the United States Army. The/
sediments in the bay continue to contain elevated levels of mercury even after/
multiple remediation attempts by the army. Mercury source determination was/
done by interpreting total mercury concentrations and isotope ratios of the sediments/
within the bay.
