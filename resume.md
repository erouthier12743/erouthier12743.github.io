### Education
**Harvard University (2022-present)**\
PhD student in Environmental Science and Engineering advised by\
Dr. Elsie Sunderland. Research focus is on the cycling of contaminants\
in the environment, with a current focus on mercury.


**University of Wisconsin - Madison**\
*Bachelor of Science - Biochemistry, 2020*\
*Bachelor of Science - Environmental Sciences, 2020*

**Homestead High School**\
Science Department Prize in Environmental Science

### Relevant Experience

**Physical Scientist (2020-2022)**, USGS Mercury Research Lab\

* Conducted daily laboratory analysis of samples for mercury

* Collected field samples for in house and contracted projects
 
* Assisted with research and development related to measurement techniques for mercury

* Contributed to publishing study findings

**Student Intern**, USGS Mercury Research Lab

* Laboratory and field assistant

**Research Assistant**, Karasov Lab - UW - Madison\
Supervised by Dr. William Karasov and Gavin Dehnert

* Studied the effects of the herbicide 2,4-Dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid on freshwater fish species

* Maintained animal welfare and conducted biochemical assays

* Conducted a study investigating potential recovery of fish endocrine systems after exposure to 2,4-D


**Assistant ranger**, University of Wisconsin - Madison Arboretum\

* Maintained arboretum grounds and helped visitors enjoy the nature


### Technical Skills
**Programming languages**\
R (beginner), python (beginner)

**Lab skills and unstruments**\
Total mercury analysis via Nippon, Tekkran and Brooks Rand instruments
methylmercury analysis via distillation and ICPMS
Mercury isotope analysis via MC-ICPMS
Pre-concentration methods using purge and trap, and anion exchange column methods


**Software**\
ArcGIS, Microsoft Suite

### Service and Leadership

**Boy Scouts of America - Eagle scout**

**UW - Madison Track Club Meet Coordinator**
Organize team events and plan the season's race schedule

### Current Projects and Research

**Malagasy dietary mercury exposure**\
Working with Dr. Elsie Sunderland and Dr. Chris Golden, we are investigating/
the dietary sources of mercury for two populations of people who display distinct/
dietary patterns. Dietary sources  and toxicokinetics of mercury are determined via dietary surveys,/
exposure models and isotope mixing models. We are further investigating the impact gut microbiome/
has on Hg toxicokinetics.

**Mercury in the Rio Negro, Brazil**\
With Dr. Sunderland, Dr. Scot Martin, and Dr. Sergio Duvoisin Junior, we am investigating the sources/
of mercury to Amazonian rivers and pathways for methylation within these rivers.
